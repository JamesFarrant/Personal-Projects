# Personal-Projects
Derived from Martyr2's Mega-Project List (http://www.dreamincode.net/forums/topic/78802-martyr2s-mega-project-ideas-list/)

This repository has essentially been made by myself to demonstrate that I can actively code 'things'. Not well, necessarily, but hopefully it will help me to look like less of an idiot when I apply for Junior Developer jobs. Or at least show that I'm able to self-teach myself things.

2015 Goal: Commit something to GitHub every day (from Feb 2015)
